# GitHub Documentation

User documentation aiming to assist with set up and daily use of a GitHub repository.

The documentation is aimed at students and assumes that the repository will be used
in order to keep school related notes and projects synced across multiple computers, such as
a home computer and a laptop.

The documentation outlines how to initialize a repository and how to use it regularly. 

We also include a part that details how one could use a provided script to improve aspects
of the recurring GitHub workflow to remove tedious and repetitive steps.

Writing assumes that the intended audience are new full stack development students that have not used
GitHub.
